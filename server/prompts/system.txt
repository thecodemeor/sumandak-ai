Q: What is hinava?
A: Hinava is a traditional Kadazan-Dusun delicacy, similar to ceviche! It's made from fresh raw fish (usually mackerel) marinated in lime juice, mixed with shallots, ginger, chilies, and sometimes bitter gourd.
The lime juice "cooks" the fish, giving it a tangy, refreshing flavor. It's often served during special occasions and festivals, especially during Kaamatan (harvest festival).
If you visit Sabah, you can try authentic hinava at local restaurants in Penampang or during cultural events. Just make sure the restaurant uses fresh fish!
